      <p>This set of Killzone rules are intended to be used with any standard outdoor Kill Zone terrain, but with the inclusion of the "Drop Pod" terrain type. The rules assume a standard Space Marine Drop pod, but feel free to substitute an <a href="https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Rok">Ork Rok</a>, <a href="https://www.forgeworld.co.uk/en-US/Hades-Breaching-Drill">Hades Drill</a>, <a href="https://www.forgeworld.co.uk/en-US/Terrax-Pattern-Termite-Assault-Drill-2018">Terrax Assault-Drill</a> or any other troop transport which could arrive or be abandoned at an insertion zone. The pod should be equipped with a weapon for which the ACTIVATE DEFENSES tactic fits thematically. Automated heavy bolter, embedded grot with a big shoota, or similar would all be appropriate. Regardless of the vehicle type, it is immobilized once in play.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Recommended to use 1-3 pods, depending on the mission and other terrain present. Drop pods are marked on the map using the following icon:</p>

      <p><img src="images/droppod.png" width=50% height=auto class="center"></p>

      <div class="subtitle" id="environment">Killzone Environment</div>
        <p>Drop pods introduce additional resources and dangers to the battlefield. Orbital insertion kicks up dust and debris, hindering visibility, or a fast moving team may establish a shooting position to pick-off late arrivals. The defensive armament of deployed pods may still be active, and the pods themselves may contain objects of interest to your kill team - either battlefield trophies or valuable medical supplies.</p>

        <p>One player rolls a D6 once the battlefield has been set up but before kill teams are set up, and consults the environment table to determine what additional rule is used for this mission. Depending on the result, an additional Environment tactic may be available to players.</p>

        <p>Additionally, missions in the Drop Site Killzone permit players use of any <b>Drop Site Tactic</b>.</p>

    <p>The Drop Site represents a landing zone at which at least two kill teams find themselves engaged in combat. Missions vary - matched missions do not assume either kill team actually inserted via drop pods, but narrative missions may benefit if the insertion vehicle thematically fits one of the factions in the battle. For this style of narrative mission, the players are encouraged to find a suitable vehicle or even a piece of terrain (e.g. crater/burrow hole for Tyranids) to represent this insertion.</p>

<!-- COMMENTARY SECTION -->
<div class="pagecontent">
  <div class="subtitle" id="commentary">Commentary</div>
  <p>A few thoughts on the design of this Killzone and related missions. This is a fan-made Killzone for the game of Kill Team by Games Workshop, and is not affiliated with Games Workshop in any way.</p>

  <div class="columntext">

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Killzone: Drop Site</h3>
      <p>I love the drop pod as a concept and the drop pod model. Unfortunately, as a strictly Kill Team player, I had no use for one. Gameplay wise, I find it interesting to introduce a scenery/mission element which (in addition to cover) provides area control from automated weapons, but also let players push their luck to go for a tactically important move. I have also tried to include tactics and effects which would fit with a variety of Kill Team factions, although they may favor teams with fewer models. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Mission - Strip the LZ</h3>
      <p>This is a basic (and perhaps boring) objective fight mission, centered around drop pod centerpieces. Victory conditions favor getting stuck in around the pods. ACTIVATE DEFENSES tactic should favor the team who can get to the pods first, at the risk of exposure. Victory conditions do allow for a team which prefers to sit back to still catch up in VPs at the end of the game, provided they are well positioned.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Mission - Late Arrival</h3>
      <p>The idea here is to have a mission which requires early positioning around an unknown objective. Once that objective is revealed, a dedicated group of models can force an instant win. Deployment zone and objective marker placements could probably still use some tweaking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Mission - Get Off the X</h3>
      <p>This mission is intended to be a running fight. CLOSE WITH THE ENEMY tactic allows attackers to charge without fear of minimal movement. BURST ‘EM DOWN synergizes with this strategy to provide assault weapons a place in close combat. FINISH THE JOB reduces the chance of getting bogged down by a single model, and incentivises keeping friendly models together. It also provides defenders additional chances to earn VPs by taking models out of action.</p>

      <p>Victory conditions seem to favor the choice of using an Elite style teams if the attacker. FINISH THE JOB tactic favors horde teams. </p>

      <p>Mission might need balancing for Horde vs Elite teams, but heck, it’s a narrative mission anyways - enjoy!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Mission - Destroy the Depot</h3>
      <p>Considering Killteam mustering after selecting attacker/defender roles.</p>

      <p>Tactics might favor the attacking team in terms of fun-factor, but seems this has potential for trying to bog down players near the containers, as well as discouraging the attacking player from staying too close to the containers. </p>

      <p>The attacking player may also have a tough decision to save command points to extend the battle to round 5 or to use those command points to secure victory on turn&nbsp;4.</p>

    <h3>THE KILL TEAMS</h3>
    <p>This is a mission for two players. Each player chooses a Faction keyword, and the players reveal their choices at the same time. Then each player chooses a Battle-forged kill team (see page 62) that only includes models with the Faction.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>THE BATTLEFIELD</h3>
      <p>This mission is played on any Kill Zone which might reasonably be an outside environment, and should have 2-3 drop pods (or equivalent) in the center of the battlefield. Roll on the environmental table after all terrain and objective markers have been placed, but prior to the deployment phase. If the "Scanning for Hostiles" effect was rolled, the Late Arrivals drop pod begins with ACTIVATE DEFENSES tactic in effect upon arrival.</p>

      <h4>Objectives</h4>
      <p>Place 1 drop pod in the center of the table, and 2 additional drop pods halfway along a diagonal line between corners of the board. If just using 2 drop pods, place each drop pod 12" from the closest corner along the same diagonal line.</p>

      <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
      <p>Deployment zones are from opposite corners not in line with the drop pods, in a triangle with 10" legs along each edge of the board.</p>

      <p>The players roll off, and the player with the lower roll chooses which deployment zone will be their own. The other deployment zone will be their opponent's. The players then take it in turns to deploy one model from their kill team, starting with the player who lost the roll-off. Models must be set up wholly within their own deployment zone. Once the players have set up their models, deployment ends and the first battle round begins.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>BATTLE LENGTH</h3>
      <p>At the end of round 4, roll a D6. On a 3+ the battle continues. At the end of round 5, the battle continues on a roll of 4+. If not yet ended, the battle ends at the end of battle round 6.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>VICTORY CONDITIONS</h3>
      <p>At the end of each battle round award 1 VP to each player for every drop pod they have with models within 1" of the base of the pod. At the end of the game, for each drop pod, award 2 VPs to the player with the most models within 1" of the base of that drop pod in addition to the VP from the end of the battle round.</p>

      <h4>Pod Arrival</h4>
      <p>Starting on turn 2, roll a D6 at the beginning of each movement phase. On a 4+ a drop pod arrives at one of the objective markers. On turn 3, add +1 to the die roll. The pod automatically arrives at the beginning of turn 4. On an unmodified roll of 6, the pod arrives with ACTIVATE DEFENSES tactic in effect.</p>

      <p>If the "Scanning for Hostiles" effect was rolled on the Killzone Environmental Effects table at the beginning of the battle, the Late Arrivals drop pod begins with ACTIVATE DEFENSES tactic in effect.</p>

      <h4>Pod Location and Placement</h4>
      <p>Roll a D3 to determine which marker.</p>

      <p>Any model within 2" of the objective marker must be immediately moved to the nearest spot 2" away from the
      marker and immediately suffers D3 mortal wounds.</p>

      <p>Place a drop pod model at this location. Players may use the EXTRACT INTEL tactic at this drop pod until the end of

      <p>The players roll off, and the player with the lower roll chooses if they will be the attacker or defender, and which deployment zone will be their own. The other deployment zone will be their opponent’s.</p>

      <p>In this mission, the attacker deploys in the circle around the central drop pod.</p>

      <p>The players then take it in turns to deploy one model from their kill team, starting with the player who lost the roll-off. Models must be set up wholly within their own deployment zone. Once the players have set up their models, deployment ends and the first battle round begins.</p>

      <p>At the end of the battle, if the Attacker has moved at least a single model off of any edge of the board, they are awarded 1 VP. If the Attacker has moved 50% or more of their models off the <em>same edge</em> of the board, award 3 VPs instead. Defenders are awarded 1 VP for each enemy model taken out of action.</p>

      <p>At the end of the battle, if the Attacker has moved 20% of their models rounding down (minimum of one model) off of the edge of the board, they are awarded 1 VP. If the Attacker has moved 50% or more of their models off the edge of the board, award 3 VPs instead.</p>

    <div class="missionname">DESTROY THE DEPOT</div>
    <div class="missionflavortext">
      <p>Alerted by the thunderous boom of a drop pod slamming down nearby, sentries position themselves to defend a munitions depot. A kill team spills from the pod, as defenders reinforce their initial sentries. Upon arrival, the first task for the sabotage strike force is to destroy a significant portion of the enemy’s supplies. The strike force will need as many of their team as they can for their main mission, so don’t get blown up in the process!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="columntext">
      <h3>THE KILL TEAMS</h3>
      <p>This is a mission for two players. Each player chooses a Faction keyword, and the players reveal their choices at the same time. Then each player chooses a Battle-forged kill team (see page 62) that only includes models with the Faction keyword they chose.</p>

      <p>Muster Killteams prior deciding which player will be attacker and which player will be defender. See BATTLEFIELD section for details on selecting roles.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>THE BATTLEFIELD</h3>
        <p>This mission is played on any Kill Zone which might reasonably be an outside environment. It uses 3 large munition containers from Kill Zone: Sector Munitorium, and 5-8 pieces of scatter terrain roughly equal in size. Decide on the number of pieces of scatter terrain before deciding on which player will be the attacker or defender.</p>

        <p>The players roll off, and the player with the higher roll chooses to be either the attacker or the defender during this mission.</p>

        <p>On the mission map, note the 8 dashed set-up lines radiating from the center of the board to the center of each board edge as well as each corner. The defender places three munitorium containers such that they touch at least two lines dividing the board, and no container touches the same lines as the other containers. The defender then places the scatter terrain touching these lines, with a maximum of one piece of scatter terrain per line, and such that all pieces are outside of the attackers deployment zone.</p>

        <p>Roll on the environmental table after all terrain and objective markers have been placed, but prior to the deployment phase.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
        <p>The defending player must deploy 25% of their models (rounding up) within 15” of their edge of the board. After these models are deployed, the attacking player places the drop pod within their deployment zone, at least 3” from any terrain. The attacker must then deploy their entire kill team within 1” of the base of the drop pod. All models must be set up wholly within their own deployment zone.</p>

        <p>Defender deploys the remainder of their kill team at the beginning of their movement phase in the first battle round. All models placed in this way must start with their base in contact with the short board edge in the defender’s deployment zone.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>INITIATIVE PHASE</h3>
        <p>The attackers automatically win the first initiative phase. The defending player may not use the DECISIVE MOVE, DECISIVE SHOT or DECISIVE ATTACK tactics in the first battle round.</p>

        <p>The players then take it in turns to deploy one model from their kill team, starting with the player who lost the roll-off. Models must be set up wholly within their own deployment zone. Once the players have set up their models, deployment ends and the first battle round begins.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>BATTLE LENGTH</h3>
        <p>At the end of battle round 4, the attacker may choose to use the DELAY ENEMY REINFORCEMENTS for 3 command points to extend the battle by a single round. Otherwise the battle concludes at the end of round 4. </p>
