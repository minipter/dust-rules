      <p>This set of Killzone rules are intended to be used with any standard outdoor Kill Zone terrain, but with the inclusion of the "Drop Pod" terrain type. The rules assume a standard Space Marine Drop pod, but feel free to substitute an <a href="https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Rok">Ork Rok</a>, <a href="https://www.forgeworld.co.uk/en-US/Hades-Breaching-Drill">Hades Drill</a>, <a href="https://www.forgeworld.co.uk/en-US/Terrax-Pattern-Termite-Assault-Drill-2018">Terrax Assault-Drill</a> or any other troop transport which could arrive or be abandoned at an insertion zone. The pod should be equipped with a weapon for which the ACTIVATE DEFENSES tactic fits thematically. Automated heavy bolter, embedded grot with a big shoota, or similar would all be appropriate. Regardless of the vehicle type, it is immobilized once in play.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Recommended to use 1-3 pods, depending on the mission and other terrain present. Drop pods are marked on the map using the following icon:</p>

      <div class="subtitle" id="environment">Killzone Environment</div>
        <p>Drop pods introduce additional resources and dangers to the battlefield. Orbital insertion kicks up dust and debris, hindering visibility, or a fast moving team may establish a shooting position to pick-off late arrivals. The defensive armament of deployed pods may still be active, and the pods themselves may contain objects of interest to your kill team - either battlefield trophies or valuable medical supplies.</p>

        <p>One player rolls a D6 once the battlefield has been set up but before kill teams are set up, and consults the environment table to determine what additional rule is used for this mission. Depending on the result, an additional Environment tactic may be available to players.</p>

        <p>Additionally, missions in the Drop Site Killzone permit players use of any <b>Drop Site Tactic</b>.</p>

    <p>The Drop Site represents a landing zone at which at least two kill teams find themselves engaged in combat. Missions vary - matched missions do not assume either kill team actually inserted via drop pods, but narrative missions may benefit if the insertion vehicle thematically fits one of the factions in the battle. For this style of narrative mission, the players are encouraged to find a suitable vehicle or even a piece of terrain (e.g. crater/burrow hole for Tyranids) to represent this insertion.</p>

      <p>Drop pods landed in a nearby area some time ago. Unfortunately two rival commanders insist on stripping the pods for war trophies, tech, intel or to deny the enemy the same. The original passengers have since departed, but beware the pod defense systems are still active!</p>

      <p>Command has learned of a malfunctioning drop pod which has yet to arrive at the Drop Site. Sensors predict three possible landing locations within the LZ, and your team will deploy in advance of the pod’s arrival. This unmanned pod contains valuable intelligence - the mission is to extract this intel. Stay on your toes/claws/hover jets, there’s at least one other team out there looking to do the same!</p>

The strike force will need as many of their team as they can for their main mission, so don’t get blown up in the process!</p>

<!-- COMMENTARY SECTION -->
<div class="pagecontent">
  <div class="subtitle" id="commentary">Commentary</div>
  <p>A few thoughts on the design of this Killzone and related missions. This is a fan-made Killzone for the game of Kill Team by Games Workshop, and is not affiliated with Games Workshop in any way.</p>

  <div class="columntext">

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Killzone: Drop Site</h3>
      <p>I love the drop pod as a concept and the drop pod model. Unfortunately, as a strictly Kill Team player, I had no use for one. Gameplay wise, I find it interesting to introduce a scenery/mission element which (in addition to cover) provides area control from automated weapons, but also let players push their luck to go for a tactically important move. I have also tried to include tactics and effects which would fit with a variety of Kill Team factions, although they may favor teams with fewer models. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Mission - Strip the LZ</h3>
      <p>This is a basic (and perhaps boring) objective fight mission, centered around drop pod centerpieces. Victory conditions favor getting stuck in around the pods. ACTIVATE DEFENSES tactic should favor the team who can get to the pods first, at the risk of exposure. Victory conditions do allow for a team which prefers to sit back to still catch up in VPs at the end of the game, provided they are well positioned.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Mission - Late Arrival</h3>
      <p>The idea here is to have a mission which requires early positioning around an unknown objective. Once that objective is revealed, a dedicated group of models can force an instant win. Deployment zone and objective marker placements could probably still use some tweaking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Mission - Get Off the X</h3>
      <p>This mission is intended to be a running fight. CLOSE WITH THE ENEMY tactic allows attackers to charge without fear of minimal movement. BURST ‘EM DOWN synergizes with this strategy to provide assault weapons a place in close combat. FINISH THE JOB reduces the chance of getting bogged down by a single model, and incentivises keeping friendly models together. It also provides defenders additional chances to earn VPs by taking models out of action.</p>

      <p>Victory conditions seem to favor the choice of using an Elite style teams if the attacker. FINISH THE JOB tactic favors horde teams. </p>

      <p>Mission might need balancing for Horde vs Elite teams, but heck, it’s a narrative mission anyways - enjoy!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Mission - Destroy the Depot</h3>
      <p>Considering Killteam mustering after selecting attacker/defender roles.</p>

      <p>Tactics might favor the attacking team in terms of fun-factor, but seems this has potential for trying to bog down players near the containers, as well as discouraging the attacking player from staying too close to the containers. </p>

      <p>The attacking player may also have a tough decision to save command points to extend the battle to round 5 or to use those command points to secure victory on turn 4.</p>
