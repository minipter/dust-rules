    <div class="missionname">DESTROY THE DEPOT</div>
    <div class="missionflavortext">
      <p>Alerted by the roar of a drop pod slamming down nearby, sentries defending a munitions depot respond as a kill team spills out and attempts to destroy the supplies. The sabotage strike force’s first task upon arrival is to destroy a significant portion of the enemy’s munitions. The strike force will need as many of their team as they can for their main mission, so don’t get blown up in the process!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="columntext">
      <h3>THE KILL TEAMS</h3>
      <p>This is a mission for two players. Each player chooses a Faction keyword, and the players reveal their choices at the same time. Then each player chooses a Battle-forged kill team (see page 62) that only includes models with the Faction keyword they chose.</p>

      <p>Muster Killteams prior deciding which player will be attacker and which player will be defender. See BATTLEFIELD section for details on selecting roles.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>THE BATTLEFIELD</h3>
        <p>This mission is played on any Kill Zone which might reasonably be an outside environment. It uses 3 large munition containers from Kill Zone: Sector Munitorium, and 5-8 pieces of scatter terrain roughly equal in size. Decide on the number of pieces of scatter terrain before deciding on which player will be the attacker or defender.</p>

        <p>The players roll off, and the player with the higher roll chooses to be either the attacker or the defender during this mission.</p>

        <p>On the mission map, note the 8 dashed set-up lines radiating from the center of the board to the center of each board edge as well as each corner. The defender places three munitorium containers such that they touch at least two lines dividing the board, and no container touches the same lines as the other containers. The defender then places the scatter terrain touching these lines, with a maximum of one piece of scatter terrain per line, and such that all pieces are outside of the attackers deployment zone.</p>

        <p>Roll on the environmental table after all terrain and objective markers have been placed, but prior to the deployment phase.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>SCOUTING PHASE</h3>
        <p>Do not resolve the Scouting phase in this mission.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
        <p>The defending player must deploy 25% of their models (rounding up) within 15” of their edge of the board. After these models are deployed, the attacking player places the drop pod within their deployment zone, at least 3” from any terrain. The attacker must then deploy their entire kill team within 1” of the base of the drop pod. All models must be set up wholly within their own deployment zone.</p>

        <p>Defender deploys the remainder of their kill team at the beginning of their movement phase in the first battle round. All models placed in this way must start with their base in contact with the short board edge in the defender’s deployment zone.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>INITIATIVE PHASE</h3>
        <p>The attackers automatically win the first initiative phase. The defending player may not use the DECISIVE MOVE, DECISIVE SHOT or DECISIVE ATTACK tactics in the first battle round.</p>

        <p>The players then take it in turns to deploy one model from their kill team, starting with the player who lost the roll-off. Models must be set up wholly within their own deployment zone. Once the players have set up their models, deployment ends and the first battle round begins.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>BATTLE LENGTH</h3>
        <p>At the end of battle round 4, the attacker may choose to use the DELAY ENEMY REINFORCEMENTS for 3 command points to extend the battle by a single round. Otherwise the battle concludes at the end of round 4. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>VICTORY CONDITIONS</h3>
        <p>Attacker must destroy two munitorum containers using the DETONATE CHARGES tactic.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>ALTERNATIVE VICTORY CONDITIONS</h3>
      <p><em>(More challenging for Defender)</em></p>
      <p><b>Attacker Win:</b> 2-3 containers destroyed<br>
      <b>Draw:</b> 1 container destroyed<br>
      <b>Defender Win:</b> 0 containers destroyed</p>

              Use at the end of the movement phase. Select an unshaken friendly model within 1” of a munitorum container and more than 1” from an enemy model. This model may not shoot, fight or use psychic powers this turn. If this model survives to the end of the fight phase, they have successfully rigged explosives on the container - place an explosives token on the container. A container with an explosives token may be detonated using the DETONATE CHARGES tactic.</p>
