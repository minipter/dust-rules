  <!-- MISSION #1 STRIP THE LZ -->

    <div class="missionname">STRIP THE LZ</div>
    <div class="missionflavortext">
      <p>Three drop pods landed in a nearby area some time ago. Unfortunately two rival commanders insist on stripping the pods for war trophies, tech, intel or to deny the enemy the same. The original passengers have since departed, but beware the pod defense systems are still active!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="columntext">
      <h3>THE KILL TEAMS</h3>
      <p>This is a mission for two players. Each player chooses a Faction keyword, and the players reveal their choices at the same time. Then each player chooses a Battle-forged kill team (see page 62) that only includes models with the Faction.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>THE BATTLEFIELD</h3>
        <p>This mission is played on any Kill Zone which might reasonably be an outside environment, and should have 2-3 drop pods (or equivalent) in the center of the battlefield. Roll on the environmental table after all terrain and objective markers have been placed, but prior to the deployment phase. If the "Scanning for Hostiles" effect was rolled, the Late Arrivals drop pod begins with ACTIVATE DEFENSES tactic in effect upon arrival.</p>

        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <p>Place 1 drop pod in the center of the table, and 2 additional drop pods halfway along a diagonal line between corners of the board. If just using 2 drop pods, place each drop pod 12" from the closest corner along the same diagonal line.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>SCOUTING PHASE</h3>
        <p>Do not resolve the Scouting phase in this mission.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
        <p>Deployment zones are from opposite corners not in line with the drop pods, in a triangle with 10" legs along each edge of the board.</p>

        <p>The players roll off, and the player with the lower roll chooses which deployment zone will be their own. The other deployment zone will be their opponent's. The players then take it in turns to deploy one model from their kill team, starting with the player who lost the roll-off. Models must be set up wholly within their own deployment zone. Once the players have set up their models, deployment ends and the first battle round begins.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>BATTLE LENGTH</h3>
        <p>At the end of round 4, roll a D6. On a 3+ the battle continues. At the end of round 5, the battle continues on a roll of 4+. If not yet ended, the battle ends at the end of battle round 6.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>VICTORY CONDITIONS</h3>
        <p>At the end of each battle round award 1 VP to each player for every drop pod they have with models within 1" of the base of the pod. At the end of the game, for each drop pod, award 2 VPs to the player with the most models within 1" of the base of that drop pod in addition to the VP from the end of the battle round.</p>
