    <div class="missionname">GET OFF THE X</div>
    <div class="missionflavortext">
      <p>A landing or raid on the Drop Site has gone wrong. Heavy enemy presence means the team has to GET OFF THE X if they are to be able to fulfill their future missions. Escape or die trying!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="columntext">
      <h3>THE KILL TEAMS</h3>
      <p>This is a mission for two players.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>THE BATTLEFIELD</h3>
        <p>This mission is played on any Kill Zone which might reasonably be a landing zone for the drop pods or landing craft available for the players. Drop pods are likely well suited for outdoor environments, but subterranean drills or similar might work nicely for some underground or enclosed environs.</p>

        <p>Roll on the environment table after all terrain and objective markers have been placed, but prior to the deployment phase.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>SCOUTING PHASE</h3>
        <p>Do not resolve the Scouting phase in this mission.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
        <p>The players roll off, and the player with the lower roll chooses if they will be the attacker or defender, and which deployment zone will be their own. The other deployment zone will be their opponent’s.</p>

        <p>In this mission, the attacker deploys in the circle around the central drop pod.</p>

        <p>The players then take it in turns to deploy one model from their kill team, starting with the player who lost the roll-off. Models must be set up wholly within their own deployment zone. Once the players have set up their models, deployment ends and the first battle round begins.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>BATTLE LENGTH</h3>
        <p>If the attacker moves a model off of the edge of the board (see below), the battle concludes at the end of the following battle round. </p>

        <p>If at the end round 4 the attacker has not moved a single model off the edge of the board, roll a D6. On a 3+ the battle continues. At the end of round 5, the battle continues on a roll of 4+. The battle automatically concludes at the end of battle round 6 regardless of if the attacker moved their first model off of the board during round 6.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>VICTORY CONDITIONS</h3>
        <p>During the movement phase, the attacker may move any models off of a single board edge. Keep track of which models leave by which board edge using a method such as leaving these models alongside this board edge until the VP are counted.</p>
        <p>At the end of the battle, if the Attacker has moved at least a single model off of any edge of the board, they are awarded 1 VP. If the Attacker has moved 50% or more of their models off the <em>same edge</em> of the board, award 3 VPs instead. Defenders are awarded 1 VP for each enemy model taken out of action.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>ALTERNATIVE VICTORY CONDITIONS</h3>
        <p><em>(More complicated, but more balanced for high model-count kill teams)</em></p>
        <p>During the movement phase, the attacker may move any models off of a single board edge. Keep track of which models leave by which board edge using a method such as leaving these models alongside this board edge until the VP are counted. (same as above)</p>

        <p>At the end of the battle, if the Attacker has moved 20% of their models rounding down (minimum of one model) off of the edge of the board, they are awarded 1 VP. If the Attacker has moved 50% or more of their models off the edge of the board, award 3 VPs instead.</p>

        <p>Defenders 1 vp for each 20% of the enemy models taken out of action.</p>

            Use at the end of the fight phase when you have two or more unshaken models within 1” of a single enemy model, and more than 1” from all other enemy models. Your models may fight again as if it were the fight phase. They do not count as having charged this turn.</p>

              Use when declaring a Charge against a single enemy model. Instead of rolling for a charge as normal, the model may roll as if it were an advance move (including any abilities which allow rerolls for advances or charges).</p>
            <p>Charged models may react as normal.</p>
            <p>The both models do not count as having charged this turn for both the shooting (e.g. may fire a pistol) and fight phases (e.g. does not fight during the <em>Hammer of Wrath</em> portion of the phase).</p>
