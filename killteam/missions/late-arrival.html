  <!--MISSION # 2: Late Arrival  -->
  <div class="pagecontent">

    <div class="missionname">LATE ARRIVAL</div>
    <div class="missionflavortext">
      <p>Command has learned of a malfunctioning drop pod which has yet to arrive at the Dropzone. You will deploy in advance of the pod's arrival, and command has predicted three possible landing locations within the LZ. This unmanned pod contains valuable intelligence, and it is your Kill Team's mission to extract this intel. Stay on your toes/claws/hover jets, there's at least one other team out there looking to do the same!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="columntext">
        <h3>THE KILL TEAMS</h3>
        <p>This is a mission for two players. Each player chooses a Faction keyword, and the players reveal their choices at the same time. Then each player chooses a Battle-forged kill team (see page 62) that only includes models with the Faction.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>THE BATTLEFIELD</h3>
        <p>This mission is played on any Kill Zone which might reasonably be an outside environment.</p>

        <p>Roll on the environmental table after all terrain and objective markers have been placed, but prior to the deployment phase. If the "Scanning for Hostiles" effect was rolled, the Late Arrivals drop pod begins with ACTIVATE DEFENSES tactic in effect upon arrival.</p>

        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <p>Place 3 numbered objective markers no closer than 5" from each other, 5" from any board edge or deployment zone, and 3" from any terrain. For matched play, place one marker equidistant from each deployment zone along the centerline of the board. Place the other two markers equidistant from the centerline of the board, parallel to the long edge of the board (see map below).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>SCOUTING PHASE</h3>
        <p>Do not resolve the Scouting phase in this mission.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
        <p>Deployment zones are within 9" of the short edge of the board.</p>

        <p>The players roll off, and the player with the lower roll chooses which deployment zone will be their own. The other deployment zone will be their opponent's. The players then take it in turns to deploy one model from their kill team, starting with the player who lost the roll-off. Models must be set up wholly within their own deployment zone. Once the players have set up their models, deployment ends and the first battle round begins.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>BATTLE LENGTH</h3>
        <p>The battle ends when one side has successfully completed using the EXTRACT INTEL tactic OR at the end of battle round 6.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>VICTORY CONDITIONS</h3>
        <p>The side who successfully completes the Extract Intel tactic before the end of battle round 6 wins. If the battle automatically ends at the end of round 6, the player with the most models within 1" of the base of the late arrival drop pod is the winner.</p>

        <h4>Pod Arrival</h4>
        <p>Starting on turn 2, roll a D6 at the beginning of each movement phase. On a 4+ a drop pod arrives at one of the objective markers. On turn 3, add +1 to the die roll. The pod automatically arrives at the beginning of turn 4. On an unmodified roll of 6, the pod arrives with ACTIVATE DEFENSES tactic in effect.</p>

        <p>If the "Scanning for Hostiles" effect was rolled on the Killzone Environmental Effects table at the beginning of the battle, the Late Arrivals drop pod begins with ACTIVATE DEFENSES tactic in effect.</p>

        <h4>Pod Location and Placement</h4>
        <p>Roll a D3 to determine which marker.</p>

        <p>Any model within 2" of the objective marker must be immediately moved to the nearest spot 2" away from the
        marker and immediately suffers D3 mortal wounds.</p>

        <p>Place a drop pod model at this location. Players may use the EXTRACT INTEL tactic at this drop pod until the end of
        the game.</p>

              During the fight phase, activate a model which has not fought yet, is within 1” of the Late Arrival drop pod.</p>
            <p>This model may not move, react, use psychic powers, shoot, or fight during the next turn. At the end of the fight phase on the following turn, if this model is unshaken and more than 1” from any enemy model, they have successfully extracted the intel, earning 3 Victory Points and the game immediately ends. </p>
